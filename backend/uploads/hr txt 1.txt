Employee Concern: 
The employee has expressed significant dissatisfaction regarding workload distribution within 
the team. According to their feedback, certain employees are consistently burdened with high 
volumes of tasks, while others appear to have relatively lighter workloads. 
Morale & Motivation Issues: 
This imbalance has led to growing frustration among staff who feel overworked and 
underappreciated. The employee reported that morale across the team is steadily declining, 
with some members showing visible signs of stress, fatigue, and disengagement. 
Collaboration Impact: 
Due to the uneven allocation of work, teamwork and collaboration have suffered. Employees 
feel reluctant to cooperate fully, fearing additional responsibilities may be unfairly shifted onto 
them. This has created communication barriers and reduced trust across the team. 
Risks Identified: 
If the current situation persists, the employee believes there may be serious long-term 
consequences, including: 
● Higher levels of burnout among top performers 
● Increased absenteeism and lower productivity 
● Declining employee engagement and workplace satisfaction 
● Risk of attrition, especially among skilled staff who feel exploited
